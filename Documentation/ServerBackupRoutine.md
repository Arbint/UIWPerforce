# Server Backup Routine

Server is backed up every friday night around 12:00 AM.

During the backup process, the server is down and the following files are generated by perforce:

```checkpoint``` 

```journal```

These files stores the state of the server so far, and are essentail for the recorvery.

The backup routine then copies the ```checkpoint``` and the ```journal``` file, as well as all the important files in the perforce root directory to a backup folder. The current backup folder is in:
```
Jingtian_OneDrive/p4ServerRootBackup/
```
Multiple backups should be inside, with the backup date written in the directory name:

## How to rebuild the server from the backup files:

To recreate the Server, download the files from the OneDrive backup folder

* First, delete all the db.* files, those can be regenerated by the ```checkpoint``` file. If they do not exists, nothing needs to be done.

* Open the terminal at the downloaded backup folder. type in command 

```
p4d -r . -jr ./checkpoint.[checkpoint number]
```
the ```checkpoint number``` will be different every time, look at the files in the folder, and you should find a file named ```checkpoint.``` with a number after the ```.```, if the file name is ```checkpoint.3```, then your console command will be:

```
p4d -r . -jr ./checkpoint.3
```
This will rebuild the ```db*``` files needed for the server to know the history and files.

* Install the license. move the license file to your perforce server root dir:
``` 
mv /path/to/license /p4root/license
```

* Ensure the correct file ownership and permission of the license:
```
chown perforce:perforce /p4root/license
chmod 644 /p4root/license
```

* Start the server:
``` 
p4d -r . -d
```

* If the depots are missing, recreate them should make them reappear.

```
p4 depot mgd_seniorthesis2024
```
be sure to configure the depot to use the same type. (local, stream, etc) and have the corrent Map (Map: /mgd/mgd_seniorthesis2024/)

The server should be up and running.
