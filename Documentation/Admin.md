Some admin tasks are easier with the [CLI](AdminConsole.md) tools.

## Users

* To add a User, go to the ```Users & Groups``` tab, and right click on any of the users under the users list, and select ```New User...```

## Group

Users under the same group share the pemission settings of that group. For example, the ```Faculty``` group contains the faculty users, and have ```Admin``` access to the entire Server, the can also create/delete users and depots. The ```Student``` group only has the ```write``` access of the ```defaultDepot``` depot on the server, they do not have acess to other depots, and they can't create depot or accounts.

* To make a group, right next to the ```users``` list, there is the ```groups``` list. Right click on any of the groups in the list and select ```New Group``` to make a new one.

* Under ```Group```, type in the new group name. Click on the ```Browse...``` button to select which users are to be assigned to the new group. And then click on ok to finish the group creation.

* You can right click on a group and do the edit or delete just like how you can edit and delete a user.

## Permission
* After a ```Group``` or ```User``` is created, you should set their Permissions, Under the ```Permissions``` tab, the list on the top allows you to view the permissions of each user and group. The table at the bottom allows you configure their permission.

Click on the ```Insert Line``` button <img src="../Assets/InsertLineBtn.png"> allows you to add a new Configuration.

The settings you can configre are:

|   Settings         |  Description                                                                                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Level       | Level of access you want to give the user or group                                              |
| User/Group         | Do you want to configure the access level for a User or a Group, pick one of the 2              | 
|Name                | the User or Group name you want to configure access                                             |
|Host                | List of computers that has access to the server, a * means any machine from any where can access|
|Foder/File          | What folders(Depots) or files you want grant access to the user or group                        |

For example, the last entry of the image above says:
```
The Students group has the write access of the defaultDepot from anywhere(Host = *).
```
The 6-8th line of the list says:
```
The GPIII group has super access to only the Assembly_Line, Synth_Escape, Triforce_Zeros depots from anywhere. 
```
## Depot

* To create a new Depot, go to the ```Depots``` tab, right click on any of the depot in the list below, and click ```New Depot...```:

* Type in the depot name for the new depot in the pop up window and click on ```OK```:

* In the pop up window next, the default depot type now is a stream depot, steams are Perforce's vision of how Git Branches should be. If you are not comfortable using streams, besure to change the type to local. The ```Storage location for versioned files:``` setting by default is your-depot-name/... this setting will create a subfolder called your-depot-name under the root folder of the server. if you want more strture, you can add a nested directory.
Click ```Apply``` to finish creating the server.
