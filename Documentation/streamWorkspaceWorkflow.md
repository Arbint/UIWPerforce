# Stream Workspace Workflow

### General Workflow
Streams follow a very controlled hierarchical structure. consider the following stream structure for the Light Chaser project:

The ```Light_Chasers``` stream is the parent stream of the ```Light_Chasers_Art``` stream and the ```Light_Chasers_Programming``` stream.

The little monior icon is located on the ```Light_Chaser_Programming``` stream.
