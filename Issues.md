# Issues

If the Sever is down for a long time and seems to be in a limbo state, try one of the following

* Log in the server machine, fire up a terminal as administrator, and type 
```sh
sc start perforce
```
if a log pop up saying server start pending, then the server should be restarted.


* Restart the Server Computer


* If you cannot access the server machine, ask professor Li to help do it remotely.
